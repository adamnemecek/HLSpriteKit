  // TODO: Using elapsedTime means that each action state stores duration and
  // elapsed-time-since-start.  The alternative would be to pass in a global clock time,
  // and have each action state store its duration and time-started.  The latter would
  // avoid the drift caused by adding lots of small floating point numbers.  However, it's
  // easier to deal with elapsed time for now; we can always change it later.

  // note: Some edge cases in terms of actions, elapsed time, and duration:
  //
  //   . What if an action has a duration of 0.0?  Does it get called once or not at all?
  //
  //   . What if a slow update rate (frame rate) causes our elapsed time to miss the
  //     duration by a large margin?
  //
  //   . What if a simple durated action (like a wait, or this base-class implementation)
  //     gets updated exactly when elapsed time equals duration?
  //
  // The general rule is this: Actions must be allowed to complete themselves regardless
  // of elapsed time and duration.  The action update method gets called until it returns
  // NO, and then it is never called again.  For simple durated actions, they will
  // complete when elapsed time is greater than or equal to the duration; for collections
  // of actions, though, possible floating point error prevents this invariant, and they
  // will complete only when all their actions are completed.
  //
  // One motivating example is HLCustomAction, which wants to guarantee to invoke its
  // selector with elapsed-time-exactly-equal-to-duration even if we miss that exact
  // moment (allowing the owner to finalize state).  So we must update the action until it
  // gets that chance, at which time it will return NO.  Furthermore, it shouldn't have to
  // track whether or not it has already done so: Once it returns NO from update, it
  // shouldn't be updated again.
  //
  // And another motivating (and complicating) example is a sequence, which calculates its
  // duration as the sum of its actions' durations, but (due to possible floating point
  // error) cannot know that all its actions have completed based on elapsed time and that
  // sum.
  //
  // In short:
  //
  //   . The boolean return value signifies "not yet completed"; when it is NO, the action
  //     has completed.
  //
  //   . This base class implementation is a simple durated event, and so it is completed
  //     when elapsed time is greater than or equal to the duration.  But our descendant
  //     classes, especially collections of actions, might very well override this opinion
  //     of completion.
